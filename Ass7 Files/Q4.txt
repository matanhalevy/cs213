In order to test pc_spinlock we used print to print out the wait times for both the consumer and producer, additionally to counts of how many items were being used. We initially anticipated for the wait times for consumer and producer to be close due to the two threads being given to both each and they should be called an equal amount of times. This means the amount of time spent when itm is 0 or max will be about the same for both the consumer and producer.

The histogram told us how many items were present during any moment, we also expected that incremented quantities, ie. 7 and 8 or 1 and 2,will have similar outputs due to item locks. The end of the hisogram have higher counts, this is due to consumers being to to wait when items areat max and producers are told to wait when items are 0. During the time they wait the opposite thread would have produced/consumer 1 or 2 items.
