Explanation: Because we implemented asynchronous reads we no longer need to
wait for the processor to finish the read before scheduling the next one, and 
thus we schedule all of the reads, and read all of the scheduled as they are 
scheduled, which vastly cuts down the time it takes to finish all of the reads.
